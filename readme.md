Rust bindings for COM
=====================

Some crates to deal with COM

* `com-types`

  Re-exports the individual com type crates for publishing.

* `com-core`

  Idiomatic Rust bindings for core COM.

  State: 20% - WIP.

* `com-sys`

  Macros and Traits for defining the COM FFI bits.

  State: 95% - This is fine. Changes, if any, will be minor.
